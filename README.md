# SomeBashScripts
Here I put some of my Bash scripts. 
Those scripts including functional ones and small tools(like something just to make research life easier). 

List of bash scripts:

1. autodown.sh
							
		This the file for downloading, reorganizing and renaming. 
		Also it will call MATLAB to execute data processing part. 
		All in several clicks.
	
2. createdata.sh

		A few lines to avoid forgetting anything from generating initial coordinates. 
		You will have to set $data as your moltemplate file path in .bash.rc
         
3. movefile.sh

		Another "make life easier" tool to copy the initial file but not any outputs/processed data into a new file folder. 
		Just input the old file folder name and the new file folder name.
