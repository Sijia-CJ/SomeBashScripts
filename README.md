# SomeBashScripts
Here I put some of my Bash scripts. 
Those scripts including functional ones and small tools(like something just to make research life easier). 

List of bash scripts:

1. autodown.sh
				This the file for downloading, reorganizing and renaming. Also it will call MATLAB to execute data processing part. All in several clicks.
2. createdata.sh
         
3. movefile.sh
